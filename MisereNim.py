"""
Two people are playing game of MisÃ¨re Nim. The basic rules for this game are as follows:
    (1) The game starts with n piles of stones. Each pile has si stones.
    (2) The players move in alternating turns. During each move, the current 
        player must remove one or more stones from a single pile.
    (3) The player who removes the last stone loses the game.

Given the value of n and the number of stones in each pile, determine whether the person 
who wins the game is the first or second person to move. If the first player to move wins, 
print First on a new line; otherwise, print Second. Assume both players move optimally.

Function Description
Complete the misereNim function below.
misereNim has the following parameters:
INPUT:
    int s[n]: the number of stones in each pile
OUTPUT:
    string: either First or Second
